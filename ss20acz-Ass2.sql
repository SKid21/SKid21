--          ============================
--
-- TASK ONE - Insertion of data ( 3 parts )
-- TASK TWO - Queries ( 12 in total )
--
-- PLESE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.
-- -----------------------------------
--
-- BEFORE YOU START you must check you have completed the following:
-- 
--  0 Download MICE_Table_and_Data.sql from CANVAS. It is available
--    from the assignment description window
--  0 Upload and run script (F5) on MICE_Table_and_Data.sql in an
--    SQL Developer worksheet.
--    You should see the following output:
--
-- Dropping Tables ...
-- Create Tables ...
--  ... A2_CINEMA
--  ... A2_STAFF
--  ... A2_CINEMA (FK Manager added)
--  ... A2_SCREEN

--
-- All tables populated.
--
--  0 Confirm that 6 new tables exist all starting in A2_ and they contain data
--
--  0 PLEASE NOTE: all tables referenced in your inserts and queries must start
--    with A2_ . This distinguishes them from previous tables and they all appear
--    in a group on the SQL Developer connections window.
--
--  0 Check each table contains data records. The number of records in each is
--    given above as reported when running MICE_Table_and_Data.sql.
--
--  0 ONLY once you are happy with the tables and data, should you progress to
--    the two tasks:
--
--
-- TASK ONE - ADDING DATA - 16 marks in total
-- ======================
--
-- You must add the following data to that already inserted into the 6 table
-- schema.
-- DO NOT remove any existing records
--
-- ADD the following:
--
--  1 - Create a yourself as a member of staff which includes your name and where
--      the Employee_No is  your SRN. The remaining attributes can be data you make
--      up. There should be no duplication between your SRN and the data in the
--      dataset, but if this does occur, add 1 to your SRN.
--      You can choose which cinema you are employed at unsupervised!!
--                                                                  [ 4 marks ]
INSERT INTO a2_staff ( EMPLOYEE_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE_NO, DOB, DATE_JOINED, SALARY, SUPERVISOR, CINEMA )

--
--  2 - Create two showings at a cinema and screen of your choice from the database.
--
--      Showing 1 MUST contain a single performance of a new film you must also add
--      to the film table. 
--						  						                    [ 6 marks ]
INSERT INTO a2_film ( FILM_NO, FILM_NAME, CLASSIFICATION, DURATION, DESCRIPTION, YEAR_RELEASED )
VALUES ( '99922211', 'Transformers', '12A', '140', 'The Autobot and the decepticon war moves from a decemated cybetron to Earth for an ultimate showdown.', TO_DATE('2007', 'YYYY' ));

INSERT INTO a2_showing ( cinema, film_no, screen, showing_no )
VALUES ( 'Grange Cinema', '99922211', '4', '183566' );

VALUES ( '99922211', TO_DATE ('15/09/2021', 'DD/MM/YYYY'), TO_DATE ('20:30', 'HH24:MI'), 1800, 200);
--
--  3 - Showing 2 MUST contain three performances of a film already in the
--      database showing on consecutive days.
--								  				                    [ 6 marks ]
--
--
--  NOTES:
--	Its a good idea to store your final INSERT commands in a script file
--
--	If during this process, you corrupt the dataset, go back and use the
--      script downloaded to reset the original tables and data
--
--	Once you are happy ALL INSERTS are correct, it may be a good idea to
--      run the two scripts ( supplied and yours) again to refresh the
--      dataset before starting Task 2
