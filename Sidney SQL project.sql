-- TASK ONE - ADDING DATA - 16 marks in total
-- ======================
--
-- You must add the following data to that already inserted into the 6 table
-- schema.
-- DO NOT remove any existing records
--
-- ADD the following:
--
--  1 - Create a yourself as a member of staff which includes your name and where
--      the Employee_No is  your SRN. The remaining attributes can be data you make
--      up. There should be no duplication between your SRN and the data in the
--      dataset, but if this does occur, add 1 to your SRN.
--      You can choose which cinema you are employed at unsupervised!!
--                                                                  [ 4 marks ]

--
--  2 - Create two showings at a cinema and screen of your choice from the database.
--
--      Showing 1 MUST contain a single performance of a new film you must also add
--      to the film table. 
--						  						                    [ 6 marks ]

--      database showing on consecutive days.

--
--  NOTES:
--	Its a good idea to store your final INSERT commands in a script file
--
--	If during this process, you corrupt the dataset, go back and use the
--      script downloaded to reset the original tables and data
--
--	Once you are happy ALL INSERTS are correct, it may be a good idea to
--      run the two scripts ( supplied and yours) again to refresh the
--      dataset before starting Task 2
